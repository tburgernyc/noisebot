# STATE — noise_bot

Updated: 2026-07-15b (session: edge research survey + E3 evaluation + product track)

## What changed this session

- HYPOTHESES.md canonical file confirmed UNRECOVERABLE (exhaustive search:
  machine, trash, .xfer chunks, all Claude transcripts, GitHub incl. private
  repos via authed SSH + logged-in web). Old H1/H2: UNTESTABLE — lost in the
  Windows→Ubuntu wipe. Noise-area edge ARCHIVED as falsified.
- Repo pushed to github.com/tburgernyc/noisebot (public; data/ excluded —
  Databento license). Process fix live: registration = commit + push.
- HYPOTHESES.md v2 written; E1 and E2 registered pre-test with Tim's
  approval, then evaluated ONCE each (log: logs/phase2_e1e2_2026-07-15.log).
- New code: edges.py (E1/E2 pure logic), test_edges.py (11/11 PASS incl.
  no-lookahead truncation invariance on real data), phase2_e1e2.py (gate
  runner reusing baseline metrics/barrier-MC). Baseline suite still green.
  noise_area.py untouched.

## Verdicts

- BASELINE (noise-area): FAIL — PF 0.98, n=512. Archived falsified.
- H1/H2 (old):           UNTESTABLE — registered definitions lost.
- E1 (ORB+compression):  FAIL — PF 1.12, n=183, half2 negative, OR10
                          plateau negative, P(blow) 50.9%. Falsified.
- E2 (VWAP reversion):   FAIL — PF 0.79, n=818, everything negative.
                          Falsified decisively.
- E3 (last-hour flow):   FAIL — PF 0.81, n=503, both halves negative,
                          plateau all negative, P(blow) 87%. Falsified.

## Window ledger

Databento MNQ 2024-07→2026-07: 4 evaluations burned (baseline, E1, E2, E3). Window heavily mined — prefer NEW data for next registration.
Yahoo 60-day: burned for selection (data-QA only).

## Blockers

None mechanical. The blocker is intellectual: no registered hypothesis
with a mechanism distinct from the three falsified families.

## Parallel track (income)

Prop-firm risk guard EA (MQL5 marketplace utility) — spec at
~/mql5_products/prop_risk_guard/SPEC.md. Sells enforcement, not
performance. Zero client interaction.

## Single next action

Trading: next registration requires NEW data (candidate: month-end
rebalancing pressure needs ~8yr ES/MNQ history, ~$10-20 Databento; or
BTC/ETH daily for slow trend — free). Income: build risk guard EA v0.1
per spec Phase 1.
